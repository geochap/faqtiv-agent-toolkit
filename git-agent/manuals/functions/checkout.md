# Manual: checkout Function

## Overview

The `checkout` function is an asynchronous function designed to interact with the Git version control system. Its primary purpose is to facilitate branch management by allowing users to create and switch to a new branch within a specified directory.

## Function Signature

```javascript
async function checkout(directoryPath, branchName)
```

### Parameters

- **`directoryPath`** (string): The file path to the directory where the Git repository resides. This directory is where the branch operations are executed.

- **`branchName`** (string): The name of the new branch to be created and checked out. This branch will be a new addition to the repository, and you will be switched to this branch upon successful execution.

### Return Value

- **`result`** (Promise): A promise that resolves with the result of the Git command execution. The result typically includes the output from the Git execution, such as confirmation messages or errors.

## Prerequisites

- Ensure Git is installed and configured on your system.
- The specified `directoryPath` must be a valid Git repository.
- You must have write permissions in the repository to create and switch to a new branch.

## Usage

To use the `checkout` function effectively:

1. **Integrate the Function**: Incorporate the function into your code where you manage Git repositories, making sure to handle the returned promise appropriately.

2. **Call the Function**: Invoke the `checkout` function with the appropriate parameters. For example:

   ```javascript
   checkout('/path/to/my/repo', 'new-feature-branch')
     .then(result => {
       console.log('Branch created and switched: ', result);
     })
     .catch(error => {
       console.error('Error during checkout: ', error);
     });
   ```

3. **Handle Results**: Use `.then()` and `.catch()` to manage the outcome of the operation, handling both successful branch creation and any errors that may occur.

## Notes

- The function uses the `git checkout -b` command under the hood, which simultaneously creates a new branch and switches to it.
- If a branch with the specified `branchName` already exists, the command will fail.
- Ensure that there are no unsaved changes in your working directory to avoid possible conflicts or data loss when switching branches.
