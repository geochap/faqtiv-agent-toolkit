# Task Manual: Initialize Faqtiv Agent

## Purpose

The purpose of the task is to initialize a new Faqtiv agent in a specified directory. This is essential for setting up a new project environment for managing tasks, functions, and configurations within the Faqtiv framework.

## Description

The task performs the initialization of a Faqtiv agent by setting up the necessary files and directories in a given path. It ensures that the environment is prepared for further operations such as adding tasks, functions, or modules. It also supports specifying a runtime environment, with the default being JavaScript.

## Parameters

- **Directory Path**: The file system path where the Faqtiv agent should be initialized. This path determines where the agent's configuration and operational files will be stored.

- **Runtime (optional)**: The runtime environment for the Faqtiv agent. By default, this is set to 'JavaScript', but it can be changed to other supported runtimes as needed.

## Usage

To use the task, provide the absolute directory path where you want the agent to be initialized. Optionally, specify the desired runtime if it differs from the default. The task will set up the necessary framework to make the directory ready for Faqtiv operations.

## Expected Outcome

Upon successful execution, the directory will contain all the essential files for a Faqtiv agent, configured with the specified runtime environment. A success message confirming the initialization will be returned.

## Notes

Ensure that the provided directory path is valid and accessible with the necessary write permissions before executing the task. If the directory or files already exist, the task may overwrite them or refuse to operate based on existing configurations.
