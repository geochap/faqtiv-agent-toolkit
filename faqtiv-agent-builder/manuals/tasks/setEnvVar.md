# Task: Setting an Environment Variable for the Faqtiv Agent

## Purpose
The task is designed to set a specific environment variable within a Faqtiv agent. This allows users to configure the runtime environment of the agent dynamically, enabling customization and adaptability based on different deployment situations or operational requirements.

## Usage
To execute the task, you need to provide the following parameters:

- **Agent Directory Path**: The directory path where the Faqtiv agent is located. This parameter ensures the task targets the correct agent.

- **Key**: The name of the environment variable you want to set. The key is a string identifier for the variable.

- **Value**: The value to be assigned to the environment variable. The value is set as a string and should represent the configuration you wish to apply for this variable.

## Outcome
Upon successful execution, the environment variable specified by the key is set to the provided value in the specified agent's environment. A confirmation message indicating the success of the operation is produced, confirming the variable has been set as intended.
