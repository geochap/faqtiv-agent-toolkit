# Task Manual: Updating Faqtiv Agent Headers

## Overview

The task is designed to update the headers within a Faqtiv agent located at a specified directory path. Updating headers is a critical part of maintaining the integrity and up-to-date status of the configuration and documentation within the agent.

## Purpose

The primary purpose of the task is to ensure that all headers within the Faqtiv agent are current and correctly set as per the latest requirements. This covers updating various metadata and structural components critical to the agent's operation and documentation.

## Usage

To execute the task:

1. Identify the directory path where the Faqtiv agent is located. The directory path should be an absolute path to ensure accuracy.
2. Invoke the task with the identified directory path.

## Expected Outcome

Upon successful execution of the task, all headers within the designated Faqtiv agent should be updated to their latest versions. This ensures that any changes or enhancements to the agentâ€™s configuration or documentation are reflected accurately.

## Error Handling

If an error occurs during execution, it might be due to:

- Incorrect directory path: Verify that the path is correct and accessible.
- Permission issues: Ensure that the executing user has the necessary permissions to modify headers in the specified directory.

In case of an error, re-evaluate the provided inputs and ensure that all prerequisites are satisfied before re-executing the task.

## Notes

- The task does not require any additional parameters apart from the agent directory path.
- It is recommended to validate the results post-execution to confirm that the headers have been updated as intended.
