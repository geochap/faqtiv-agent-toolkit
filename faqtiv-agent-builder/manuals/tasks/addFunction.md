# Task Manual

## Purpose

The task is designed to add a new function to a Faqtiv agent. It facilitates the integration of additional capabilities into an existing agent by allowing users to specify both the name and the code of the function. 

## Usage

### Parameters

- `agentDirectoryPath`: The directory path where the Faqtiv agent is located. This is required to identify the agent to which the function is to be added.
- `functionName`: The name of the function being added. This should be a valid JavaScript identifier as it will be used to reference the function within the agent.
- `functionCode`: The JavaScript code that implements the function. This code should be properly structured and ready to be executed by the agent.

### Execution

When executed, the task will insert the specified function into the chosen Faqtiv agent, making it available for future operations within the agent. Upon successful completion, a confirmation message indicating the function's successful addition will be logged. 

In case of any issues such as incorrect path, function name conflicts, or invalid code syntax, the operation will encounter an error, and the function addition will be aborted. Adjust parameters accordingly and re-attempt the operation if necessary.
