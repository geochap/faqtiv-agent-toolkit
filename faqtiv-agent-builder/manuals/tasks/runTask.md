# Task: Execute an Existing Task by Name

## Purpose
The task is designed to execute an existing task within a faqtiv agent environment. It utilizes the task's name and a list of provided arguments to run the task efficiently, capturing and displaying the resulting output.

## Usage

### Inputs
- **agentDirectoryPath**: The path to the directory where the faqtiv agent is located. This is required to identify and access the correct agent environment.
  
- **taskName**: The name of the task that needs to be executed. This identifies which task will be run within the agent.

- **packedArgs**: A string of arguments separated by commas. These arguments are optional and provide additional parameters needed for the task execution.

### Outputs
- The output of the executed task as a string. Once the task completes execution, its results will be displayed to the user.

## Considerations
- Ensure that the specified task exists within the agent by verifying its name before attempting execution.
- Arguments should be formatted correctly as a comma-separated string if they are required for the task execution.
- Proper error handling should be in place within the running environment to handle any execution failures or incorrect parameter issues.
