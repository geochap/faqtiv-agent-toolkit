## `setEnvVar` Function Manual

### Purpose
The `setEnvVar` function allows users to set or update environment variables within a project managed by the Faqtiv command-line tool. This function modifies environment variables to ensure the necessary configurations are available for the agent's operations.

### Usage

```javascript
async function setEnvVar(agentDirectoryPath, key, value)
```

- **Parameters:**
  - `agentDirectoryPath` (string): The path to the directory where the agent's environment variable settings are managed. This is the directory where the `.env` file is typically located.
  - `key` (string): The name of the environment variable to be set or updated. It acts as the identifier for the variable.
  - `value` (string): The value to assign to the environment variable. This value will be escaped for secure shell execution to prevent command injection vulnerabilities.

- **Returns:** A promise that resolves with the result of the `executeAgentCommand` function, signifying successful setting or updating of the environment variable, or detailing any errors encountered during the process.

### Function Details

- **Shell Escaping:** The `value` parameter is processed to ensure it is safely escaped, preventing issues related to command execution in shell environments.
- **Command Execution:** Utilizes the Faqtiv framework's capabilities to securely set environment variables within the specified directory.

### Related Commands in Faqtiv

- **Set Environment Variable Command (CLI):** Directly from the Faqtiv command-line interface, environment variables can be managed through:

  ```bash
  faqtiv set-env-var <key> <value>
  ```

  Replace `<key>` with the environment variable's name and `<value>` with the desired value.

### Important Considerations

- The `agentDirectoryPath` must accurately point to the correct directory containing the configuration files for changes to take effect.
- Ensure the `key` and `value` are correctly specified to prevent overwriting existing variables with unintended data.

### Best Practices

- Use version control or maintain backups of your configuration settings to ensure any inadvertent changes can be reverted.
- Regularly review and document environment variables for clarity and maintenance.
- Implement error handling for the promise to manage any unsuccessful environment variable setting operations effectively.
