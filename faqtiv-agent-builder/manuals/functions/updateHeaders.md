## `updateHeaders` Function Manual

### Purpose
The `updateHeaders` function is designed to update the headers of functions in an agent's directory within a project managed by the Faqtiv command-line tool. This is crucial for maintaining accurate function metadata, ensuring clarity and consistency across the project's codebase.

### Usage

```javascript
async function updateHeaders(agentDirectoryPath)
```

- **Parameters:**
  - `agentDirectoryPath` (string): The path to the directory where the agentâ€™s associated functions are located. This path is vital for identifying the correct location for updating function headers.

- **Returns:** A promise that resolves to the result of executing the command, indicating whether the headers were successfully updated or if errors occurred during the process.

### Functionality

- **Function Header Update:** This function automatically scans through the codebase in the specified directory and updates the headers of functions to reflect current information, metadata, or other descriptive attributes.

### Related Commands in Faqtiv

- **Update Headers Command (CLI):** Updating function headers can be directly achieved through the command-line interface using:

  ```bash
  faqtiv update-headers
  ```

  This command performs the same operation directly through the Faqtiv CLI.

### Important Considerations

- Ensure that `agentDirectoryPath` is accurately provided to prevent updating the wrong set of function headers or encountering access issues.
- This function is critical for maintaining code quality; regular updates keep function documentation consistent with the current code implementation.

### Best Practices

- Regularly execute this function to ensure all functions have up-to-date headers, contributing to better documentation and readability.
- Implement proper error handling to capture any issues that arise during the header update process, allowing for swift identification and rectification of problems.
- Combine this operation with other documentation or metadata management practices to streamline project maintenance and support clearer project overviews.
