## `compileTask` Function Manual

### Purpose
The `compileTask` function is designed to compile a specified task within an agent's directory in a project managed by the Faqtiv command-line tool. This function aids in preparing tasks for execution by compiling them using the available functions and libraries within the agent's workspace.

### Usage

```javascript
compileTask(agentDirectoryPath, taskName)
```

- **Parameters:**
  - `agentDirectoryPath` (string): The path to the directory containing the agent and the task to be compiled.
  - `taskName` (string): The name of the task that needs to be compiled. This should match the task identifier used within the project.

- **Returns:** A promise that resolves with the outcome from `executeAgentCommand`, which attempts to compile the task. This includes either a successful compilation message or details of errors encountered during the process.

### Related Commands in Faqtiv

- **Compile Task Command (CLI):** You can also perform task compilation via the Faqtiv CLI:

  ```bash
  faqtiv compile-task [taskName]
  ```

  - Use `[taskName]` to specify a particular task, or append `--all` to compile all tasks.

### Important Considerations

- Make sure that `agentDirectoryPath` is correct and points to the right directory structure.
- Task names should be unique and correctly spelled to ensure that the correct task is compiled.
- This function primarily ensures tasks are ready for execution by compiling them with current agent instructions and functions.

### Best Practices

- Confirm that all dependencies and functions within the agent's workspace are up-to-date before compiling tasks.
- Consider implementing error handling in your promises to manage unsuccessful compilations effectively.
- Regularly review your tasks and functions to optimize the agent's performance and execution readiness.
