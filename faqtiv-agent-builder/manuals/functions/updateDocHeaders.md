## `updateDocHeaders` Function Manual

### Purpose
The `updateDocHeaders` function is used to update the documentation headers within a Faqtiv-managed project. This function ensures that all documentation files have up-to-date headers that serve as an index for the files, aiding in better document organization and navigation.

### Usage

```javascript
async function updateDocHeaders(agentDirectoryPath)
```

- **Parameters:**
  - `agentDirectoryPath` (string): The path to the directory where the agent and its documentation files are located. This path is used to determine the location of documentation resources for updating their headers.

- **Returns:** A promise that resolves with the result of the command execution, indicating the success or failure of updating the documentation headers.

### Functionality

This function interacts with the documentation files to update their headers, which are essential for providing a structured overview of the content and ensuring that navigational elements reflect the current state of the documentation.

### Related Commands in Faqtiv

- **Update Documentation Headers Command (CLI):** Documentation headers can also be updated using the following command from the CLI:

  ```bash
  faqtiv update-doc-headers
  ```

  You may use the `--force` option to force-update the headers if required.

### Important Considerations

- Ensure `agentDirectoryPath` correctly points to the directory containing your documentation files, as incorrect paths could lead to errors or missed updates.
- The tool automatically updates headers; ensure documentation files are not actively edited during the update to prevent conflicts or data loss.

### Best Practices

- Regularly update documentation headers to maintain an organized and user-friendly document structure.
- Implement error handling to effectively manage any issues that arise during the documentation update process.
- Consider force-updating headers if automated or scripted changes to documentation files are performed, ensuring consistency with recent updates or edits.
