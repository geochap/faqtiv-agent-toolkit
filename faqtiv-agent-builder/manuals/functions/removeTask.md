## `removeTask` Function Manual

### Purpose
The `removeTask` function is designed to facilitate the removal of a specified task from an agent's directory within a project managed by the Faqtiv command-line tool. This function is essential for maintaining an organized task list by removing outdated or unnecessary tasks.

### Usage

```javascript
async function removeTask(agentDirectoryPath, taskName)
```

- **Parameters:**
  - `agentDirectoryPath` (string): The path to the directory where the agent and the task are located. This is essential to correctly identify the workspace for task management.
  - `taskName` (string): The name of the task you wish to remove. It should match the task's identifier within the project accurately.

- **Returns:** A promise resolved by executing the `executeAgentCommand`, which confirms the success of the task removal with relevant output messages or describes any errors encountered during the operation.

### Related Commands in Faqtiv

- **Remove Task Command (CLI):** Users can manage tasks directly via the Faqtiv command line, including removal through:

  ```bash
  faqtiv remove-task <name>
  ```

  Replace `<name>` with the exact name of the task to be removed.

### Important Considerations

- Accurate assignment of `agentDirectoryPath` ensures the operation targets the correct workspace.
- Precise entry of `taskName` is necessary to avoid accidental removal of the wrong task.
- If working in a larger team or shared environment, ensure proper communication about task matrix changes.

### Best Practices

- Regularly prune tasks to maintain only necessary and relevant workloads in the project setup.
- Employ appropriate error handling for the asynchronous function to capture and log unsuccessful operations.
- Consider implementing backup strategies or consistent version control usage to mitigate accidental deletions, allowing easy restoration if needed.
