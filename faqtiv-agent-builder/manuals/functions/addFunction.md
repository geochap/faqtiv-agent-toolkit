# `addFunction` Manual

## Overview

The `addFunction` function is an asynchronous JavaScript function used to facilitate the addition of a new function to a project managed by the Faqtiv command-line tool. It integrates with the Faqtiv system to efficiently handle the inclusion of function code into the project's structure.

## Purpose

The main purpose of `addFunction` is to streamline the process of adding new functions to a project directory managed by Faqtiv. It takes care of escaping the function code for shell execution and invokes the appropriate command to incorporate the function within the project ecosystem.

## Parameters

- `agentDirectoryPath`: *(string)* The path to the directory of the agent where the function is to be added. This specifies the target location within the Faqtiv project.
- `functionName`: *(string)* The name of the new function to be created. This will be used to identify the function within the project.
- `functionCode`: *(string)* The string representation of the function code that you wish to add.

## Returns

The function returns a promise that resolves once the `add-function` command execution completes. This promise will provide the outcome of the operation, typically indicating success or error.

## Usage

To use `addFunction`, you need to provide the path to the agent directory, the desired function name, and the function code. Here's a simple usage example to illustrate its application:

```javascript
async function exampleUsage() {
  const agentDirectoryPath = '/path/to/agent';
  const functionName = 'myNewFunction';
  const functionCode = `
    function myNewFunction() {
      console.log('Hello, World!');
    }
  `;

  try {
    const result = await addFunction(agentDirectoryPath, functionName, functionCode);
    console.log('Function added successfully:', result);
  } catch (error) {
    console.error('Error adding function:', error);
  }
}
```

## Additional Information

- The `addFunction` uses Faqtiv's `add-function` command to insert the new function within the project. The function code is specifically escaped to avoid any shell execution issues that might arise due to special characters or syntax.
- It is part of a broader set of functionalities provided by Faqtiv to manage projects, handle tasks, and organize modules and functions efficiently.
