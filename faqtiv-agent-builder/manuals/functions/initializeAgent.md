## `initializeAgent` Function Manual

### Purpose
The `initializeAgent` function is designed to initialize a new agent within a specified directory for a Faqtiv-managed project. It sets up the agent's environment, preparing it for further development and integration with the project's tasks, modules, and functions.

### Usage

```javascript
initializeAgent(agentDirectoryPath, runtime = 'javascript')
```

- **Parameters:**
  - `agentDirectoryPath` (string): The path to the directory where the agent is to be initialized. This forms the root workspace for the agent's operations.
  - `runtime` (string, optional): The runtime environment for the agent. It can be set to either `'javascript'` or `'python'`, with `'javascript'` as the default.

- **Returns:** A promise that resolves to the output of the `executeAgentCommand` function, confirming the success of the initialization process or detailing any issues encountered.

### Steps for Initialization

1. **Project Directory Setup:** The specified `agentDirectoryPath` will be used as the base directory for setting up the agent, including necessary configurations and environment setups.
2. **Runtime Specification:** Ensure the correct runtime is chosen, as this will impact the libraries and framework compatibility for the agent.
3. **Command Execution:** The function interacts with the underlying system to carry out initialization commands, ensuring the agent is properly configured.

### Related Commands in Faqtiv

- **Initialize Agent Command (CLI):** You can also initialize a new agent via command-line using:

  ```bash
  faqtiv init <projectRoot> --runtime <value>
  ```

  Replace `<projectRoot>` with the directory path and `<value>` with the runtime choice (`javascript` or `python`).

### Important Considerations

- Ensure that `agentDirectoryPath` is correct and accessible with necessary permissions for initialization.
- Choose your runtime appropriately based on the project's requirements and existing codebase.

### Best Practices

- Verify that your development environment matches the runtime requirements to avoid setup issues.
- Regularly back up your configurations, especially before significant changes or initializations.
