## `updateFunction` Function Manual

### Purpose
The `updateFunction` function is designed to update the code of an existing function in a project managed by the Faqtiv command-line tool. This operation allows users to replace outdated or incorrect code with new implementations, ensuring that functions remain useful and effective as project requirements evolve.

### Usage

```javascript
async function updateFunction(agentDirectoryPath, functionName, newCode)
```

- **Parameters:**
  - `agentDirectoryPath` (string): The path to the directory where the agent and the function files are located. This serves as the base directory for executing the update operation.
  - `functionName` (string): The name of the function to update. This must match the existing function identifier within the project's function directory.
  - `newCode` (string): The new source code to replace the existing code of the function. This code will be securely escaped for shell execution to ensure its safe and stable integration.

- **Returns:** A promise that resolves with the result of the function update operation. This result includes success confirmation or error details if the update fails.

### Related Commands in Faqtiv

- **Update Function Command (CLI):** The Faqtiv tool provides a CLI command to update functions, which can be used as follows:

  ```bash
  faqtiv update-function <name> <newCode>
  ```

  Replace `<name>` with the name of the function and `<newCode>` with the updated function code.

### Important Considerations

- Ensure the `agentDirectoryPath` points to the correct agent directory, and the `functionName` accurately identifies an existing function to avoid errors.
- Securely handle `newCode` to avoid introducing vulnerabilities through improper escaping or malformed code.

### Best Practices

- Validate the new code for correctness and security before applying it to prevent introducing bugs or vulnerabilities.
- Regularly review and update function implementations to align with new project objectives or standards.
- Implement error handling methods to manage and log any issues that occur during updates efficiently, facilitating easier debugging and maintenance.
