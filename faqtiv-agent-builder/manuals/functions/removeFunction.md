## `removeFunction` Function Manual

### Purpose
The `removeFunction` function is designed to facilitate the removal of an existing function from a project managed by the Faqtiv command-line tool. It supports maintaining an organized and updated function list by removing unnecessary functions from the agent's directory.

### Usage

```javascript
async function removeFunction(agentDirectoryPath, functionName)
```

- **Parameters:**
  - `agentDirectoryPath` (string): The path to the directory where the agent and its associated functions are located.
  - `functionName` (string): The name of the function to be removed. This should precisely match the function's identifier within the project.

- **Returns:** A promise that resolves to the result of the `executeAgentCommand` execution. The outcome indicates whether the function was successfully removed or if any errors occurred during the process.

### Related Commands in Faqtiv

- **Remove Function Command (CLI):** The tool provides a command-line interface to remove functions directly:

  ```bash
  faqtiv remove-function <name>
  ```

  - Replace `<name>` with the specific function's name you wish to remove.

### Important Considerations

- Ensure that `agentDirectoryPath` is correctly specified and points to the right agent directory before executing the removal operation.
- Accurate spelling and specification of `functionName` are essential to ensure the correct function is targeted for removal.

### Best Practices

- Regularly review and clean up your function list to remove obsolete or unused functions, enhancing project maintainability and performance.
- Incorporate error handling for the promise to manage unsuccessful attempts at function removal effectively.
- Ensure backups or version control snapshots are available when removing critical or uncertain functions to prevent loss of essential functionality.
