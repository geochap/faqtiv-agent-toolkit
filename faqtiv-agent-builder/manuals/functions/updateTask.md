## `updateTask` Function Manual

### Purpose
The `updateTask` function is designed to update an existing task's description within an agent's directory in a project managed by the Faqtiv command-line tool. This function ensures that task descriptions are kept current and reflective of any changes in project requirements or task objectives.

### Usage

```javascript
async function updateTask(agentDirectoryPath, taskName, taskDescription)
```

- **Parameters:**
  - `agentDirectoryPath` (string): The path to the directory where the agent and its tasks are located. This identifies the context within which the task update occurs.
  - `taskName` (string): The name of the task to be updated. This name serves as a unique identifier for locating the task.
  - `taskDescription` (string): The updated description of the task. It expresses the changes or new details in the task's purpose and execution parameters.

- **Returns:** A promise that resolves with the result of the update operation, indicating successful task description updates or error details if the process fails.

### Functionality

- **Secure Update:** Utilizes `executeAgentCommand` for secure task updates, ensuring the task description is appropriately formatted and integrated.

### Related Commands in Faqtiv

Due to the currently limited support for direct command execution, similar tasks might be achieved through manual scripting or future updates within the Faqtiv framework.

### Important Considerations

- Confirm that `agentDirectoryPath` accurately points to the correct directory of the agent to ensure successful task targeting.
- Task name (`taskName`) and description (`taskDescription`) should be precise and updated according to the latest project needs to maintain effective task management.

### Best Practices

- Regularly review and update task descriptions to maintain accuracy and alignment with ongoing project changes.
- Validate and format the task descriptions properly to avoid errors and enhance task execution clarity.
- Implement effective error handling within the promise to track and manage any issues during the update operation efficiently.
