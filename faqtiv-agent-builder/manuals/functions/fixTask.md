## `fixTask` Function Manual

### Purpose
The `fixTask` function is crafted to correct or improve a specified task within an agent's directory using feedback. This function integrates with the Faqtiv command-line tool, which manages projects and tasks efficiently by allowing adjustments to tasks based on performance feedback.

### Usage

```javascript
fixTask(agentDirectoryPath, taskName, feedback)
```

- **Parameters:**
  - `agentDirectoryPath` (string): The directory path where the agent and task are located. This is the working directory for the command.
  - `taskName` (string): The name of the task to be fixed or improved. This should match an existing task identifier in the project.
  - `feedback` (string): Detailed feedback on the task's performance or outcome. This feedback guides the modifications needed to enhance the task.

- **Returns:** A promise that resolves with the result from `executeAgentCommand`, indicating whether the task was successfully fixed or if errors were encountered during the process.

### Related Commands in Faqtiv

- **Fix Task Command (CLI):** Faqtiv provides a command to perform this action directly from the CLI:

  ```bash
  faqtiv fix-task <name> <feedback>
  ```

  - Substitute `<name>` with the task's name and `<feedback>` with the relevant feedback information.

### Important Considerations

- Ensure that `agentDirectoryPath` is specified correctly and the agent directory is accessible at runtime.
- Provide specific, clear feedback to better direct the modifications needed on the task.
- This function processes shell commands, so ensure that feedback text is well-escaped to prevent command injection vulnerabilities.

### Best Practices

- Regularly review task performances and gather constructive feedback to improve task functionality and outcomes.
- Implement robust error handling to capture failures or issues with the task-fixing process.
- Continuously update related functions and modules to ensure compatibility and performance efficiency with task fixes.
