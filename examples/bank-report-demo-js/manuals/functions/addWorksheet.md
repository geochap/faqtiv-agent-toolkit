## `addWorksheet` Function Manual

### Overview
The `addWorksheet` function is used to add a new worksheet to an existing workbook. This is a common task when working with spreadsheet manipulation libraries in JavaScript, such as ExcelJS, where creating and managing multiple tabs/sheets within a workbook is necessary.

### Purpose
The primary purpose of this function is to provide a straightforward way to create new worksheets within a workbook, allowing for organized data management across different sheets.

### Inputs

1. **workbook**: This parameter represents the workbook object to which the new worksheet will be added. It is usually an instance of a workbook from a library that supports sheet manipulation.

2. **sheetName**: A string that specifies the name of the new worksheet to be created. This name is used as the tab name that appears within the workbook, often to indicate the type of data or the specific content held within the sheet.

### Outputs

The function returns the newly created worksheet object. This object can then be utilized to perform further operations such as adding data, styling, or creating tables within the new worksheet.

### Usage
To effectively use the `addWorksheet` function:
- Ensure the workbook object provided is already created and initialized.
- Choose a descriptive and unique name for the `sheetName` to avoid conflicts within the workbook and to clearly represent the sheet's purpose or content.
- Use the returned worksheet object to perform further tasks, such as populating the sheet with data or applying styles.

The `addWorksheet` function simplifies the process of expanding a workbook's capability by managing multiple datasets or report sections across several sheets systematically.
