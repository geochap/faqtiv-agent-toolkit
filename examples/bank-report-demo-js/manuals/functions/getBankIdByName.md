## `getBankIdByName` Function Manual

### Overview
The `getBankIdByName` function is an asynchronous function that allows you to fetch the unique identifier (ID) of a bank based on its name. This function queries a database using an external API to find active banks matching the provided name.

### Purpose
The main purpose of this function is to simplify the lookup of a bank's unique ID. This ID can then be used for further queries or operations that require the bank's official numeric identifier, such as retrieving detailed financial data or branch information.

### Inputs

- **name**: A string input that signifies the name of the bank you wish to find. It is essential to provide an accurate and possibly complete name to ensure the function retrieves the correct bank ID.

### Outputs

The function returns a Promise that resolves to a string. This string is the unique identifier (ID) of the bank that matches the provided name. If the bank name corresponds to multiple entries or if no bank is found, the function will handle this internally and may return the first matching ID or undefined, respectively.

### Usage
To effectively use the `getBankIdByName` function:
1. Ensure your environment supports asynchronous operations with `async/await` or promise handling.
2. Invoke the function with the desired bank's name as the argument.
3. Handle the returned bank ID to perform further operations or store it as necessary for your application.

This function is particularly useful for applications that require quick retrieval of bank identifiers based merely on names, aiding in processes that need to link descriptive data with numeric key-based data systems.
