## `getBankBranches` Function Manual

### Overview
The `getBankBranches` function is an asynchronous function that retrieves information about all branches of a specified bank using its unique ID. This function accesses an external API to collect structured data about the bank's locations.

### Purpose
The main purpose of this function is to fetch detailed information about each branch of a bank, such as address, city, state, and ZIP code, enabling the integration of this data into applications that require geographic or identification details of bank branches.

### Inputs

- **bankId**: This parameter is a string that represents the unique certificate ID assigned to a bank by regulatory authorities. It is a required input used to query the API for the specific bank's branch information.

### Outputs

The function returns a Promise that resolves to an array of objects. Each object in the array represents a bank branch with the following properties:
- **id**: The unique identifier for the branch.
- **address**: The physical address of the branch.
- **city**: The city in which the branch is located.
- **county**: The county where the branch is situated.
- **state**: The state in which the branch operates.
- **zip**: The ZIP code for the branch location.

### Usage

To use the `getBankBranches` function effectively:
1. Ensure your JavaScript environment supports asynchronous operations, since the function utilizes `async/await` syntax.
2. Pass a valid `bankId` to the function to specify the bank for which branch information is desired.
3. Handle the returned data using asynchronous constructs like `then()` or `async/await` to access and process the array of branch details.

This function is particularly useful for applications or systems that need to visualize, report, or analyze geographical distribution and logistical information of bank branches based on a given bank's ID. It leverages external API services to aggregate comprehensive data efficiently.
