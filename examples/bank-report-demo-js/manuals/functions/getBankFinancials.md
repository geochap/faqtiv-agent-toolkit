## `getBankFinancials` Function Manual

### Overview
The `getBankFinancials` function is an asynchronous operation that fetches financial data for a specific bank by its ID. This function retrieves the latest financial figures from an external API, specifically focusing on core metrics such as total assets and deposits.

### Purpose
The primary purpose of this function is to provide an easy way to access and format key financial data points for banks. This information can be crucial for stakeholders who require timely and organized financial reports.

### Inputs

- **bankId**: This is a string input representing the unique identifier or certificate number assigned to a bank. It is essential for querying the API to fetch the correct information corresponding to the particular bank of interest.

### Outputs
The function returns a Promise that resolves to an array of objects. Each object contains two main properties:
- **report_date**: A string formatted as 'YYYY-MM-DD', this field indicates the date for which the financial data was reported.
- **total_deposits**: A number representing the total deposits in the bank, multiplied by 1000 to convert the data into a larger scale unit (likely thousands to millions, depending on what's typical for the data set).

### Usage
To use the `getBankFinancials` function effectively:
1. Ensure JavaScript environment compatibility with asynchronous functions using `async/await` or promises.
2. Invoke the function with a valid `bankId` to retrieve financial information about the respective bank.
3. Handle the resulting data array within asynchronous constructs to extract and utilize the financial details for analysis, reports, or display in applications.

This function is invaluable for financial analysts, software applications, and reporting tools that need to access up-to-date financial summaries of banks quickly and integrate them into workflows or presentations.
