## `autoSizeColumnWidth` Function Manual

### Overview
The `autoSizeColumnWidth` function is designed to automatically adjust the width of columns in a worksheet. This function ensures that the columns are wide enough to fit the largest content in each column, enhancing the readability and presentation of the data in spreadsheets.

### Purpose
The purpose of this function is to improve the aesthetics and functionality of spreadsheets by resizing columns based on their content. This makes the data easier to read and prevents text from being truncated.

### Inputs

- **worksheet**: This parameter is the worksheet object that contains the columns you wish to resize. The worksheet must be an instance from a spreadsheet manipulation library that provides access to column properties, such as 'ExcelJS'.

### Outputs

- The function does not return any value. Instead, it modifies the worksheet in place by setting the width of each column to fit its content.

### How It Works
The function iterates through each column in the provided worksheet, determining the length of the string representation of each cell's value within a column. It calculates the maximum string length and sets the width of the column correspondingly, ensuring that the contents of the largest cell in each column are fully visible.

### Usage
To use the `autoSizeColumnWidth` function, a worksheet object with columns and content should be ready. Simply call this function and pass the worksheet as an argument. The function will resize each column based on its longest cell content.

This function is highly useful in scenarios where data contents vary greatly in size across rows and columns, and a dynamic adjustment of column width is required to maintain a clean and professional appearance.
