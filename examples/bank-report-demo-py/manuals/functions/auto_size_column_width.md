# Function Manual: `auto_size_column_width`

## Overview

The `auto_size_column_width` function is designed to adjust the width of columns in a given worksheet dynamically. This ensures that the content within each column is fully visible without any manual resizing, contributing to better readability and presentation of the spreadsheet data.

## Function Purpose

This function automatically sizes the columns to fit the largest piece of content within each column of an Excel worksheet. It helps in maintaining the aesthetics and usability of an Excel sheet by ensuring that no content is hidden or truncated.

## Inputs

- **worksheet**: This is an instance of a worksheet object from the `openpyxl` library. The worksheet represents a single sheet within an Excel workbook, which contains rows and columns of data to be manipulated.

## Outputs

The function does not return any value. Instead, it directly modifies the column widths of the provided worksheet to accommodate the largest content in each column.

## Usage

To use `auto_size_column_width`, you need to have a worksheet object that you want to format. Once you call the function with this object, it will evaluate each column, determine the maximum content length, and set the column width accordingly. If a column's content lengths are all below a certain threshold, a default minimum width of 10 is applied to ensure consistent formatting.

This function is particularly useful for users who generate Excel reports or manipulate Excel data programmatically, enabling them to create well-formatted documents without manually sizing each column.
