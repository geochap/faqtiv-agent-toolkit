# Function Manual: `add_worksheet`

## Overview

The `add_worksheet` function is a utility for adding new sheets to an existing workbook in Excel applications. This is useful for organizing data across multiple sheets within the same workbook.

## Function Purpose

This function assists in expanding a workbook by adding more sheets, each of which can serve distinct purposes or hold different datasets, thereby enhancing the organizational structure of the workbook.

## Inputs

- **workbook**: This is an instance of a workbook object, typically from the `openpyxl` library. The workbook represents an entire Excel file and is required as the target to which a new sheet will be added.
- **sheet_name**: A string that specifies the title of the new sheet to be added. This name should be unique within the workbook to avoid overwriting existing sheets.

## Outputs

- **Worksheet Object**: The function returns a newly created worksheet object. This object is an instance of the `Worksheet` class within the `openpyxl` library and represents the new sheet added to the workbook. It can be used to enter data, format cells, and perform other spreadsheet operations.

## Usage

To use the `add_worksheet` function, pass the desired workbook object and a unique sheet name as arguments. The function will create and return a new sheet within the specified workbook, ready for data entry or further manipulation.

This function is ideal for scenarios where automated or repetitive processes require the creation of numerous sheets within a single workbook file, such as batch data processing, report generation, or organizing complex datasets into separate logical entities within Excel.
