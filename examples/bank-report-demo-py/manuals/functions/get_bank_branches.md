# Function Manual: `get_bank_branches`

## Overview

The `get_bank_branches` function is designed to retrieve information about the branches of a specific bank using the bank's unique identification number.

## Function Purpose

This function is used to obtain a detailed list of branches for a given bank. This can be useful for applications or systems that need to display or process data related to bank branch locations.

## Inputs

- **bank_id**: An integer or string representing the unique certification number of the bank (often referred to as "CERT"). This identifier is used to filter the results to include only the branches associated with the specified bank.

## Outputs

The function returns a list of dictionaries, each containing details about an individual bank branch. For each branch, the following information is included:

- **id**: A unique identifier for the branch.
- **address**: The street address of the branch.
- **city**: The city where the branch is located.
- **county**: The county where the branch is located.
- **state**: The state where the branch is located.
- **zip**: The ZIP code for the branch location.

## Usage

When you call `get_bank_branches` with a valid `bank_id`, it queries the FDIC's bank location API and retrieves branch information. It then formats this data into a list of dictionaries for ease of use. This allows users to seamlessly access branch information without dealing with direct API interactions and raw data handling.

The returned data is particularly useful for applications that need to render branch locations on maps, generate reports, or integrate branch details into banking services.
