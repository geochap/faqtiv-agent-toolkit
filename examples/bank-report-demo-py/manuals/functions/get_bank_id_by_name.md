## Inputs

- **name**: A string representing the bank's name. This must match or partially match the bank's registered name in the FDIC's database to successfully retrieve the correct bank ID.

Upon retrieving the data, it extracts and returns the unique ID of the first bank entry that matches the provided name. This ID can then be used for other API calls that require bank-specific information.

This function is particularly useful for developers and analysts who need to programmatically access banking data without manually looking up IDs, enabling seamless integration into larger systems or processes.
